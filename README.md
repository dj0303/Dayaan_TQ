A Fast/simple Node + Express backend (EJS front end) that implements user accounts, a virtual wallet and an items store. Users can register/login, 
receive a JWT (stored in an httpOnly cookie), view their wallet balance, spend credits and buy items. All operations create transaction records. 
Passwords are hashed and JWTs are used for stateless authentication.
